# ❄️Snowflake Animation

-A simple and beautiful snowflake animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## 🌐Demo

-You can see the live demo of this project here: (https://esimayc.github.io/Snowflake_Animation/)


## ✨Features

-Interactive Animation: Creates falling elements wherever you move your mouse
-Multiple Designs: Toggle between snowflake designs with a click
-Random Sizing: Each element has a random size between 20px and 70px
-Smooth Animation: Elements fall with rotation and fade-out effect
-Automatic Cleanup: Elements are removed from DOM after animation completes


## How It Works

-Move your mouse around the screen to create falling elements
-Click anywhere to switch between the available designs
-Each element will:
  -Appear at your mouse position
  -Fall downward with a slight horizontal drift
  -Rotate 360 degrees during the fall
  -Gradually fade out
  -Be removed from the DOM after completion
